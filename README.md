# CodeCell
CodeCell is a penny-sized board that helps you miniaturize your DIY robots, wearables, and IoT projects with ease! Designed for all makers, it features an Arduino-friendly ESP32-C3 Wi-Fi & BLE module, programmable through a standard USB-C cable ~ which can also charge a LiPo battery that easily plugs into the onboard connector.

Thatâ€™s not all! We've created a CodeCell library to make it easier to interact with the onboard sensors ~ it's Light Sensor can detect darkness and measure proximity up to 20 cm! While the optional Motion Sensor features a 9-axis sensor-fusion IMU to measure angular rotations, step counts, personal activity, tapping, gravity, acceleration, rate of rotation, magneticfields and more!


## Getting started with the CodeCell Library:

### Init()
- To initialize the CodeCell, use the `myCodeCell.Init()` function with one or more of the predefined macros. Each macro corresponds to a specific sensing function. Here are the available macros:
  
  - `LIGHT`                          // Enables Light Sensing
  - `MOTION_ACCELEROMETER`           // Enables Accelerometer Sensing
  - `MOTION_GYRO`                    // Enables Gyroscope Sensing
  - `MOTION_MAGNETOMETER`            // Enables Magnetometer Sensing
  - `MOTION_LINEAR_ACC`              // Enables Linear Acceleration Sensing
  - `MOTION_GRAVITY`                 // Enables Gravity Sensing
  - `MOTION_ROTATION`                // Enables Rotation Sensing
  - `MOTION_ROTATION_NO_MAG`         // Enables Rotation Sensing without Magnetometer
  - `MOTION_STEP_COUNTER`            // Enables Walking Step Counter
  - `MOTION_STATE`                   // Enables Motion State Detection
  - `MOTION_TAP_DETECTOR`            // Enables Tap Detector
  - `MOTION_ACTIVITY`                // Enables Motion Activity Recognition

- Example Usage:
  - `myCodeCell.Init(LIGHT);`                                      // Initializes Light Sensing
  - `myCodeCell.Init(LIGHT + MOTION_ROTATION);`                    // Initializes Light Sensing and Angular Rotation Sensing
  - `myCodeCell.Init(LIGHT + MOTION_ROTATION + MOTION_STATE);`     // Initializes Light Sensing, Angular Rotation Sensing, and State Detection

Note: You can combine multiple macros using the `+` operator to initialize multiple sensors.

### Run()
- Call the `myCodeCell.Run()` function in the `loop()` to manage battery and power. This function returns true every 100ms and also handles the onboard LED to indicate power status. When the battery voltage falls below 3.3V, the LED will blink red 10 times and then go into Sleep Mode until the USB cable is connected for charging. While charging, the CodeCell will shut down the application, light the LED blue, and wait until the battery is fully charged. Once fully charged, it will start a breathing-light animation with a speed corresponding to the proximity distance. The LED will shine green when powered by the battery and blue when powered via USB.


### Read

- After initializing the sensors, you can use the following functions to read data from them:

  Sensor Read Functions:
  
  - `Light_ProximityRead()`                                            // Reads the proximity value from the light sensor
  - `Light_WhiteRead()`                                                // Reads the white light intensity from the light sensor
  - `Light_AmbientRead()`                                              // Reads the ambient light intensity from the light sensor
  - `Motion_AccelerometerRead(float &x, float &y, float &z)`           // Reads acceleration data along the x, y, and z axes
  - `Motion_GyroRead(float &x, float &y, float &z)`                    // Reads rotational velocity data along the x, y, and z axes
  - `Motion_MagnetometerRead(float &x, float &y, float &z)`            // Reads magnetic field strength data along the x, y, and z axes
  - `Motion_GravityRead(float &x, float &y, float &z)`                 // Reads gravity vector data along the x, y, and z axes
  - `Motion_LinearAccRead(float &x, float &y, float &z)`               // Reads linear acceleration data along the x, y, and z axes
  - `Motion_TapRead(uint16_t &x)`                                      // Reads the number of taps detected (tap = 1, no tap = 0)
  - `Motion_StepCounterRead(uint16_t &x)`                              // Reads the number of steps counted
  - `Motion_RotationRead(float &roll, float &pitch, float &yaw)`       // Reads angular rotational data (roll, pitch, yaw)
  - `Motion_RotationNoMagRead(float &roll, float &pitch, float &yaw)`  // Reads angular rotational data without magnetometer
  - `Motion_StateRead(uint16_t &x)`                                    // Reads the current state (On Table = 1, Stationary = 2, Stable = 3, Motion = 4)
  - `Motion_ActivityRead(uint16_t &x)`                                 // Reads the current activity (Driving = 1, Cycling = 2, Walking = 3/6, Still = 4, Tilting = 5, Running = 7, Climbing Stairs = 8)

- Example Usage:
  - `uint16_t proximity = Light_ProximityRead();`
  - `myCodeCell.Motion_AccelerometerRead(myX, myY, myZ);`
  - `myCodeCell.Motion_RotationRead(myRoll, myPitch, myYaw);`

Note: You can use `myCodeCell.PrintSensors()` to print the values of all enabled sensors on the Serial Monitor.
